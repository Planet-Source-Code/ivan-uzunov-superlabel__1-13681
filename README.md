## SuperLabel

### Description

You won to work with ActiveX controls, You won to learn how to create ActiveX controls : Ladys and Gentleman, I'm proud to present you my ActiveX control - SuperLabel. This .OCX is a 3D label. If you are bored of the usual Label1 try SuperLabel. The .OCX have the same events and properties like the ordinery Label1, exept those to work with databases ( if you ask me why : bicause this is just a example how to create ActiveX - and it works very well - I think so ), but with just little bit of code you can create a SuperLabel who can work with databases.

So please ENJOY IT and ***VOTE for ME***.
